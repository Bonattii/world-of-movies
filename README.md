## Overview

World of Movies consists in a web application where people can discover new movies and/or series and search for a specific movie and/or series.

The technologies on this project were chosen to make all the data be rendered at the server side and give the final user a better experience using the application.

One of the challenging things during this project were made the carousels on the first page and in the future I hope to change the technologies to use React in this project.

## How to install and Run the Project

To use the application you need to clone the repository to your computer

> npm install

Run this command to start the server in your machine

> node app.js

Another option would be running using nodemon

> nodemon app.js

## How to Use the Project

You have two options of search in the project, you can search by genres or by title

### Using the title search
